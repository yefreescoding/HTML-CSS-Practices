            <p> As you might know FC Barcelona isn't going for its best moment of its history,
                sportively and of course not economically. This situation has made the directive of the team
                take questionable decisions and deals for the good of the club finance, future signings and 
                goals for the upcoming seasons.

                It was predictably billed by both sides as a "first-of-its-kind" agreement. Yet Barcelona’s 
                sponsorship deal with Spotify could be more a sign of the times than the beginning of a truly 
                unique partnership.
